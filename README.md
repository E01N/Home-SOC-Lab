# Home SOC Lab Documentation

This project documents the creation of a home-based SOC (Security Operations Center) lab to demonstrate Blue Team skills including log analysis, incident response, detection engineering, and SIEM configuration.

---

## Objectives

- Build a functional SOC lab using VirtualBox and Kali Linux
- Install and configure open-source SIEM (Wazuh)
- Set up Windows endpoint(s) with Sysmon, Wazuh agent, and generate logs
- Simulate attacks using Kali and document detection/investigation
- Build a portfolio of detection reports and incident response write-ups
